## What's new

<Update label="2025-10-03" description="HubSpot CRM integration" tags={["Integrations", "New feature"]}>
  Connect your HubSpot CRM to automatically filter out existing leads during automated research, saving you time and research credits.

  - Connect HubSpot from Settings or agent configuration
  - Choose between "Companies with Deals" or "All Companies" filter modes
  - Domain-based matching to identify duplicates
  - Account-level integration works across all agents
  - Filtering happens before research to save credits

  See the [HubSpot Integration guide](/user-guide/integrations/hubspot) for setup and configuration details.

  - Create agents from the Filters sidebar
  - Schedule searches with flexible cadences
  - Ask follow‑up research questions per result
  - Export and optionally email new leads after runs

  See the [Agents guide](/user-guide/agents/overview) for details.
