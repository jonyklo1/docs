## Overview

Robots automate your saved searches and follow-up research, then optionally email results. Each robot:

- Creates/uses a dedicated View with your research conditions
- Runs a scheduled search on your chosen cadence
- Runs follow-up research questions about each result
- Can email newly found leads to selected recipients

## Create a robot

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Create Robot">Open the Filters panel and click the + in the Robots section.</Step>
<Step title="Name your robot">Choose a clear name (e.g., Cafes in Boston • Contact Info & Revenue). This becomes the Robot name.</Step>
<Step title="Select a saved search">Pick from your previously saved searches. Saved searches come from Search conversations.</Step>
<Step title="Add research questions (optional)">Choose one or more of your past questions. After the search completes, the robot runs these for every result.</Step>
<Step title="Add research conditions (optional)">Define Column, Operator, Value to narrow results. You can filter by standard fields or the answers of your selected questions.</Step>
<Step title="Schedule and limits">Pick a cadence (e.g., Weekdays at 9 AM) and results per run (10, 25, 50, 100). Times use your local timezone.</Step>
<Step title="Email exports (optional)">Enable exports and add recipients. Emails send after research completes.</Step>
<Step title="Review & create">Confirm the summary and click Create Robot.</Step>
</Steps>

What Flowi creates:

- A View named after your robot with your research conditions
- A Search schedule on your chosen cadence
- A follow-up schedule per research question (about 1 hour after the search)
- Export settings (when enabled) tied to the View
