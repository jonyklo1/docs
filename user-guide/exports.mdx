## Overview

Export selected leads to CSV based on your current view and column order. Include research answers, optionally add explanation columns, and apply lightweight transforms before download. A live preview shows exactly what will be exported.

## How exporting works

- **Selection-based**: Exports only the leads you have selected in the grid. If nothing is selected, the dialog shows a message and disables download.
- **Current view**: Uses your visible columns and custom order, matching what you see in the grid.
- **Tabs**: Works from Companies or People tabs; relationship columns adapt accordingly.
- **Preview-first**: See a live preview of the CSV and which columns are transformed before downloading.
- **Explanations toggle**: Optionally add an explanation column for each research question.

## Columns included

- **Lead Name**: The primary display name for the row (company or person).
- **Default fields**: Address, website, phone, email, LinkedIn, created at, etc. Only columns visible in your view are exported.
- **Special columns**: Relationship columns (e.g., People on Companies tab; Companies on People tab) export as comma‑separated values.
- **Research answers**: Each selected research question becomes a column with the final displayed answer.
- **Explanations (optional)**: Toggle Include explanations to add a companion column for each research question with the model’s reasoning. Headers use the question label plus “_explanation”.
- **Cross‑tab research**: If you include research questions from the opposite tab, those answers export too with clear labels.

## Transform columns (optional)

Before downloading, you can apply lightweight transformations to exported values:

- **Per‑column prompts**: Enter a short instruction per column (e.g., "Summarize in 10 words", "Convert to uppercase").
- **Apply per column**: Click Apply Transform for each column you want to change.
- **Caching**: Previously computed transforms may be reused for identical values to speed things up.
- **Non‑destructive**: Transforms affect only the export file; your underlying data remains unchanged.

## File format and naming

- **Format**: CSV (UTF‑8) with a header row.
- **Escaping**: Quotes and newlines in answers are normalized to keep CSV structure intact.
- **Filename**: `leads_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` by default.

## Steps to export

<Steps>
<Step title="Select leads in the grid">

</Step>
<Step title="Open the export dialog">
Right‑click and choose "Download N leads (CSV)".
</Step>
<Step title="Configure options and transforms">
Toggle Include explanations if you want reasoning columns. Optionally add per‑column transform prompts and click Apply Transform for each column.
</Step>
<Step title="Review and download">
Confirm the preview looks right (column order, transformed values), then click Download CSV.

<Check>
The file name is `leads_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, columns match your view order, and the row count equals your selection.

## Notes and limitations

- Export currently reflects only selected leads; bulk export of an entire filtered view requires selecting those rows first.
- If a research question has no final answer, the cell will be empty.
- Explanation columns are only added when the toggle is enabled at export time.
- Transforms apply to the exported file only; they do not update grid data.
