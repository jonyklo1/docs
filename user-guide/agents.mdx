## Overview

Agents automate your saved searches and follow-up research, then optionally email results. Each agent:

- Creates/uses a dedicated View with your research conditions
- Runs a scheduled search on your chosen cadence
- Runs follow-up research questions about each result
- Can email newly found leads to selected recipients

<Info>
  Example use cases:
  - Sweep "Cafes in Boston"; for each cafe, ask:  owner/GM name, contact email, and estimated revenue range; compile and export.
  - Build a territory list of "HVAC contractors in Phoenix metro"; for each contractor, ask: service areas, licensing, dispatch phone, and decision maker.
  - Monitor "Dentists in San Jose"; for new practices, ask: accepted insurance, primary specialties, and online booking URL; email a weekly summary.
  - Find "Vegan restaurants in Austin"; for each location, ask: delivery platforms (DoorDash/Uber Eats), seating capacity if available, and Instagram/Facebook links; export daily.
