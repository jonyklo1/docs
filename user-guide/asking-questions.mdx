## Overview

Ask questions about companies or people and stream answers directly into the grid. Responses fill dedicated research columns with live progress and references.

<Tip>
  Toggle between <b>üí° Ask Questions</b> and <b>üîç Find New Customers</b> at the bottom of the input. Use Ask Questions to <i>research selected leads</i>; use Find New Customers to <i>discover new businesses</i>.
</Tip>

<Info>
  You can research a single lead or a multi‚Äëselection. For people leads that haven‚Äôt been deep researched, you‚Äôll be prompted to run deep research first.

## Run a question

<Step title="Switch to Ask Questions">

Click the toggle chips below the input and select <b>üí° Ask Questions</b>.

<Step title="Select one or more leads">

Select a row in the grid (single) or multi‚Äëselect rows (Shift/Command). You can also open a lead in a tab and ask from there.

  Questions require a selected lead. People leads may require deep research before you can ask.
</Warning>

<Step title="Type your question">

Ask in plain English (e.g., "What does this company do?", "Key decision makers", "Recent product launches").

Optional: turn on <b>Deep Research</b> and choose target profiles (website, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook) for richer results.

<Step title="Submit and monitor">

Press Enter or click the send button. Progress streams into research columns; answers appear as they complete.

## Other ways to ask

<Steps>
<Step title="Ask about a single lead">

Select a row, right‚Äëclick, and choose <b>Ask about 1 lead</b>. Type your question (e.g., "What does this company do?", "What are recent product launches?").

</Step>
<Step title="Ask about multiple leads">

Multi‚Äëselect rows, right‚Äëclick, and choose <b>Ask about N leads</b> to run the same question across your selection.

</Step>
<Step title="Re‚Äëask saved questions">

Right‚Äëclick and choose <b>Re‚Äëask Questions‚Ä¶</b> to pick from your saved research prompts and re-run them for the current selection.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Use saved questions

- Click the clock icon next to the input to open your saved questions.
- Pick a question to fill the input or re‚Äëask it across the current selection.

<Note>
  Saved questions are typed: company vs person. Only matching questions are available for your current selection.
</Note>

## Reading results

- **Live status**: Cells show streaming progress (processing, research, deep research when enabled).
- **Answers**: Final responses render in research columns; overflow is truncated with a tooltip.
- **References**: Click the info icon to view supporting sources when available.
- **Quick re‚Äëask**: When a research cell is focused, click the small AI icon to re‚Äëask that specific question for the current row.

<Info>
  When information is partial, Flowi may deliver an initial answer and continue searching. If it finds more, you‚Äôll see an updated or follow‚Äëup answer.
</Info>

## Deep research (optional)

Use the Deep Research toggle to collect richer signals. You can target specific profiles (website, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook) when supported.

<Tip>
  Deep Research can improve coverage and precision for tougher questions, but may take longer and use additional credits.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

- **Insufficient credits**: You‚Äôll see a credit dialog if a question can‚Äôt be queued. Upgrade or purchase credits to continue.
- **No leads selected**: Select one or more rows before asking.
- **People leads require deep research**: Turn on Deep Research or run deep research when prompted, then try again.
- **No visible answers**: Ensure the research question‚Äôs column is visible in your current view; saved prompts remain available for reuse.
- **Stopped early**: The stop button pauses UI updates only; processing may continue in the background and update cells when complete.

## Tips

- Start broad ("What does this company do?") and follow up with focused prompts ("Key decision makers", "Recent funding").
- Batch re‚Äëask saved prompts to keep research consistent across an entire list.
