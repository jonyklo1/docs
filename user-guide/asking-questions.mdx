## Overview

Ask Flowi questions about companies or people and stream answers directly into the grid. Answers appear in dedicated research columns with live progress and references.

## Ways to ask

<Steps>
<Step title="Ask about a single lead">

Select a row, right‑click, and choose **Ask about 1 lead**. Type your question (e.g., "What does this company do?", "What are recent product launches?").

</Step>
<Step title="Ask about multiple leads">

Multi‑select rows, right‑click, and choose **Ask about N leads** to run the same question across your selection.

</Step>
<Step title="Re‑ask saved questions">

Right‑click and choose **Re‑ask Questions…** to pick from your saved research prompts and re-run them for the current selection.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Reading results

- **Live status**: Cells show streaming progress (processing, social search, deep research).
- **Answers**: Final responses render in research columns; overflow is truncated with a tooltip.
- **References**: Click the info icon to view supporting sources when available.
- **Quick re‑ask**: When a research cell is focused, click the small AI icon to re‑ask that specific question for the current row.

## Deep research (optional)

Use the Deep Research toggle to collect richer signals. You can target specific profiles (website, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook) when supported.

## Troubleshooting

- **Insufficient credits**: You’ll see a credit dialog if a question can’t be queued. Upgrade or purchase credits to continue.
- **No visible answers**: Ensure the research question’s column is visible in your current view; saved prompts stay available for reuse.

## Tips

- Start broad ("What does this company do?") and follow up with focused prompts ("Key decision makers", "Recent funding").
- Batch re‑ask saved prompts to keep research consistent across an entire list.
