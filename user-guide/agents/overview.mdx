## What Are Agents?

Agents are your automated research assistants that work around the clock to find, qualify, and enrich leads. Think of them as tireless team members that run your searches, ask research questions, filter results, and deliver clean data to your inbox—all on autopilot.

### What Agents Do

Each agent orchestrates a complete lead generation workflow:

1. **🔍 Scheduled Search** - Runs your saved search on a recurring cadence (daily, weekly, etc.)
2. **🎯 Research Filters** - Applies column-based filters to focus research efforts
3. **🔗 HubSpot Filtering** - Skips leads already in your CRM (optional)
4. **🤖 Automated Research** - Runs AI research questions on each qualifying lead
5. **🧰 Export Filters** - Applies final filters before exporting
6. **📧 Email Exports** - Sends results to your team automatically

## Agent Workflow

Understanding the agent workflow helps you configure filters and research at the right stage:

```
1. Search Schedule
   ↓ Finds leads based on your saved search
   
2. Research Filters
   ↓ Narrows down which leads to research
   
3. HubSpot CRM Filter (Optional)
   ↓ Removes leads already in your CRM
   
4. Automated Research
   ↓ AI asks questions about each qualifying lead
   
5. Export Filters (Optional)
   ↓ Final filtering before sending results
   
6. Email Exports
   ↓ Sends results to your team
```

<Tip>
**Credit Optimization:** Research filters and HubSpot filtering happen **before** AI research runs, so filtered-out leads don't consume research credits!
