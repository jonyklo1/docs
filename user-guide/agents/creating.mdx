## Before You Start

To create an agent, you'll need:
- At least one **saved search** (from your Search conversations)
- (Optional) Past **research questions** you want to automate
- (Optional) **HubSpot connection** for CRM filtering

<Warning>No saved searches? Run a search conversation first and save it before creating an agent.</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Agent Creation">
    Navigate to the **Agents** dashboard (accessible from the main navigation) and click the **+ Create Agent** button in the top-right corner.
    
    <Info>You can also create agents from the Filters panel by clicking the + in the Agents section.</Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name Your Agent">
    Choose a descriptive name that clearly identifies what the agent does.
    
    **Examples:**
    - "Boston Cafes • Weekly Contact Research"
    - "Phoenix HVAC • Qualified Leads > $1M"
    - "Austin Vegan Restaurants • Daily Monitor"
    
    This name becomes both the View name and appears in your Agents dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Saved Search">
    Pick from your previously saved searches. These are searches you've run in the past and saved for reuse.
    
    The saved search determines what types of leads your agent will find.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Research Filters (Optional)">
    Add column-based filters to narrow down which leads will be researched.
    
    **Example filters:**
    - Revenue > $500K
    - Employee count between 10-50
    - State = "California"
    
    These filters save research credits by focusing only on qualifying leads.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable HubSpot CRM Filtering (Optional)">
    If you've connected HubSpot, toggle this on to automatically skip leads already in your CRM.
    
    **Choose a filter mode:**
    - **Companies with Deals** - Only skip companies that have active deals (default)
    - **All Companies** - Skip any company that exists in HubSpot
    
    <Tip>Learn more in the [HubSpot Filtering](/user-guide/agents/hubspot-filtering) guide.</Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Research Questions (Optional)">
    Select one or more of your past questions. After the search completes, the agent runs these for every qualifying lead.
    
    **Common research questions:**
    - "What is the owner or GM's name and contact email?"
    - "What's the estimated annual revenue?"
    - "What are their delivery or distribution channels?"
    - "Who is the decision maker for [your product category]?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Schedule & Limits">
    Configure when and how often your agent runs:
    
    - **Cadence:** Daily, Weekdays, Weekly, Monthly, or Custom cron
    - **Time:** Choose specific time (uses your local timezone)
    - **Results per run:** 10, 25, 50, or 100 leads
    
    <Info>Start conservative (daily or weekly) and adjust based on lead volume.</Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Email Exports (Optional)">
    Enable email exports to automatically send results to your team:
    
    - Toggle "Enable email exports"
    - Add recipient email addresses (comma-separated)
    - Optionally add export filters to only send specific leads
    
    Emails are sent after all research completes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review & Create">
    Review the summary of your agent configuration and click **Create Agent**.
    
    Flowi automatically creates:
    - A dedicated View with your filters
    - A search schedule on your chosen cadence
    - Follow-up schedules for each research question
    - Export settings (if enabled)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Next?

Once created, your agent:

1. **Appears in the Agents dashboard** with "Active" status
2. **Waits for the first scheduled run** (or you can run it manually)
3. **Executes the workflow** when triggered:
   - Finds leads via saved search
   - Applies research filters
   - Checks HubSpot (if enabled)
   - Runs AI research questions
   - Applies export filters
   - Sends email exports

## Best Practices

### Start Small
Begin with conservative settings:
- 10-25 leads per run
- Weekly or daily cadence
- 1-2 research questions

Scale up once you verify the agent works as expected.

### Use Descriptive Names
Follow a naming convention for easy identification:

**Format:** `[Territory/Vertical] • [Research Type] • [Cadence]`

**Examples:**
- "Boston Cafes • Contact Research • Weekly"
- "West Coast HVAC • Qualified Leads • Daily"
- "National Dentists • Insurance Check • Monthly"

### Layer Your Filters

Maximize efficiency by filtering at multiple stages:

1. **Research Filters** - Remove unqualified leads before research
2. **HubSpot Filter** - Skip known CRM contacts
3. **Export Filters** - Only email the best leads

### Test Before Automating

Before setting a recurring schedule:
1. Create the agent with "One-time" cadence
2. Run it manually to verify results
3. Adjust filters and questions as needed
4. Update to recurring cadence once satisfied
