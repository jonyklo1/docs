**Visibility:**

- Anyone can pause/activate/delete

**Best Practices:**

- Coordinate on HubSpot filter modes
- Set appropriate export recipients

### Naming Conventions

Help teams identify agents quickly:

**Format:**
```
[Territory/Vertical] â€¢ [Research Type] â€¢ [Cadence]
```

**Examples:**
- "Boston Cafes â€¢ Contact Research â€¢ Weekly"
- "West Coast HVAC â€¢ Qualified Leads â€¢ Daily"
- "National Dentists â€¢ Insurance Check â€¢ Monthly"
- "Florida Restaurants â€¢ Revenue Analysis â€¢ Bi-Weekly"

### Territory Assignment

Organize agents by sales territory:

**Strategy:**
- Agent 1: "NorCal Restaurants" â†’ emails rep-a@company.com
- Agent 2: "SoCal Restaurants" â†’ emails rep-b@company.com
- Agent 3: "Nevada Restaurants" â†’ emails rep-c@company.com

**Benefits:**
- Automated lead distribution
- Territory-specific research
- No manual routing needed

### Export Coordination

Avoid duplicate outreach:

**Use HubSpot Filtering:**
- Prevents overlap with existing CRM
- Filters by deal status
- Account-level connection

**Configure Per Agent:**
- Different recipients per territory
- Unique export filters per vertical
- Separate research questions per market
