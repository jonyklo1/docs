## Multi-Stage Filtering

Stack filters at different stages for maximum precision and credit efficiency:

### The Perfect Filter Stack

```
üîç Search: "Coffee shops in California"
   ‚Üì
üéØ Research Filter: Revenue > $250K
   ‚Üì (Saves credits on small shops)
üîó HubSpot Filter: Skip companies with deals
   ‚Üì (Avoids active prospects)
ü§ñ Research: Owner name, contact email
   ‚Üì
üß∞ Export Filter: Only shops with confirmed email
   ‚Üì (Ensures contactable leads)
üìß Email: Send to sales team
```

### Why It Works

**Stage 1: Search**
- Casts wide net for potential leads
- Uses saved search criteria

**Stage 2: Research Filters**
- Narrows to qualified prospects BEFORE research
- Saves credits by filtering early
- Example: Revenue, employee count, state

**Stage 3: HubSpot Filter**
- Removes known CRM contacts
- Prevents duplicate outreach
- Happens before AI research (no credit waste)

**Stage 4: Research**
- AI only researches qualified, net-new leads
- Credits spent on valuable prospects only

**Stage 5: Export Filters**
- Final quality check before emailing
- Only send actionable leads
- Example: Must have email, must have decision maker name

**Stage 6: Export**
- Deliver highly qualified leads to team
- Maximum conversion potential

## Territory-Based Agent Strategy

Create location-specific agents for organized lead distribution:

### Setup

**Agent Structure:**
```
Agent 1: "NorCal Restaurants ‚Ä¢ Weekly Contact Research"
  ‚Üí Search: Restaurants in Northern California
  ‚Üí Export to: rep-north@company.com

Agent 2: "SoCal Restaurants ‚Ä¢ Weekly Contact Research"  
  ‚Üí Search: Restaurants in Southern California
  ‚Üí Export to: rep-south@company.com

Agent 3: "Nevada Restaurants ‚Ä¢ Weekly Contact Research"
  ‚Üí Search: Restaurants in Nevada
  ‚Üí Export to: rep-nevada@company.com
```

### Benefits

**Automated Distribution:**
- Leads automatically route to correct rep
- No manual assignment needed
- Territory owners get their leads directly

**Territory Intelligence:**
- Each rep sees only their region
- Can track regional trends
- Customize research per market

**Scalability:**
- Add new territories easily
- Clone existing agents
- Maintain consistency across regions

### Best Practices

1. **Use identical research questions** across territories for consistency
2. **Set same HubSpot filter mode** to ensure fair distribution
3. **Match cadence** so all territories get leads simultaneously
4. **Use clear naming** to identify territory instantly

## Seasonal Monitoring Strategy

Adjust agent behavior based on business cycles:

### High Season (Peak Demand)

**Configuration:**
- **Cadence:** Daily runs
- **Results per run:** 50-100 leads
- **Research questions:** 3-5 key questions
- **Export:** Immediate delivery

**Goal:** Catch opportunities quickly, maximize coverage

### Low Season (Moderate Activity)

**Configuration:**
- **Cadence:** Weekly runs
- **Results per run:** 25-50 leads  
- **Research questions:** 2-3 essential questions
- **Export:** Batch weekly delivery

**Goal:** Maintain pipeline, conserve credits

### Off Season (Minimal Activity)

**Configuration:**
- **Status:** Paused
- **Alternative:** Monthly runs at 10 leads
- **Research questions:** 1-2 critical questions
- **Export:** Monthly summary

**Goal:** Minimal spend, stay informed of market

## Credit Optimization Techniques

Maximize ROI on research credits:

### 1. Aggressive Pre-Filtering

**Before:**
```
Search: 500 leads found
‚Üí Research all 500 (500 credits)
‚Üí Only 50 qualify for export
Cost: 500 credits for 50 good leads = 10 credits per qualified lead
```

**After:**
```
Search: 500 leads found
‚Üí Research Filter: Revenue > $500K (removes 350)
‚Üí HubSpot Filter: Skip existing (removes 100)
‚Üí Research remaining 50 (50 credits)
‚Üí 45 qualify for export
Cost: 50 credits for 45 good leads = 1.1 credits per qualified lead
```

**Savings: 90% reduction in credit spend**

### 2. Question Consolidation

**Instead of 5 separate questions:**
- "What's the owner's name?"
- "What's the owner's email?"
- "What's the company phone?"
- "What's the company revenue?"
- "How many employees?"

**Use 2 consolidated questions:**
- "What's the owner or decision maker's name and email?"
- "What's the company revenue and employee count?"

**Savings: 60% fewer question runs**

### 3. Smart Batch Sizing

**Small Batches (10-25 leads):**
- ‚úÖ Faster execution
- ‚úÖ Test configurations quickly
- ‚úÖ Lower risk if settings wrong
- ‚ùå More frequent runs

**Large Batches (50-100 leads):**
- ‚úÖ Fewer run overhead
- ‚úÖ More leads per execution
- ‚ùå Slower execution
- ‚ùå Higher cost if settings wrong

**Recommendation:** Start small (10-25), scale to 50-100 once optimized

### 4. Export Filter Efficiency

**Inefficient:**
```
Research all leads ‚Üí Filter in export ‚Üí Low delivery rate
```

**Efficient:**
```
Research filters ‚Üí HubSpot ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Export filters ‚Üí High delivery rate
```

Always filter BEFORE research when possible

### 5. HubSpot Mode Selection

**"All Companies" mode:**
- Filters more aggressively
- Fewer leads to research
- Lower credit consumption
- Best for pure net-new

**"Companies with Deals" mode:**
- Filters selectively
- More leads to research
- Higher credit use (but more comprehensive)
- Best for re-engagement

Choose based on your goal, not just to save credits

## Advanced HubSpot Strategies

### Dual-Mode Agent Setup

Create two agents for the same search with different HubSpot modes:

**Agent 1: Net-New Prospects**
- HubSpot: All Companies mode
- Purpose: Pure cold outreach
- Export to: SDR team

**Agent 2: Re-Engagement**
- HubSpot: Companies with Deals mode
- Purpose: Dormant prospect research
- Export to: Account management team

**Result:** Comprehensive coverage without overlap

### Domain-Based Segmentation

Leverage domain matching for smart filtering:

**Use Case:** Enterprise vs. SMB
- Agent 1: Filter out enterprise domains (Forbes 500)
- Agent 2: Filter out SMB domains (< 50 employees)
- Result: Targeted research per segment
