## Overview

Use the header controls to narrow results and order rows:

- **Filters**: Add column conditions, group with AND/OR, and apply source/status filters.
- **Sort**: Choose a column and toggle ascending/descending. Clear with one click.

## Column filters

Open the Filters menu in the header.

- **Type-aware operators**: Text columns support contains, equals, starts/ends with; boolean-style columns support is_yes/is_no and emptiness checks.
- **Quick defaults**: The operator defaults to the most sensible choice based on the selected column.
- **Multiple conditions per column**: Add conditions and combine them with AND or OR.
- **Multi-value input (OR)**: For text fields, you can separate values with `|` (pipe) to match any of them.
- **Clear all**: Removes every filter and resets the grid.

## Source and research status filters

In the Filters menu, you can refine by:

- **Source**: All sources, Custom Upload, or Search Results.
- **Deep Research Status**: All, Researched, or Not Researched.

These filters combine with your column filters and update instantly.

## Sorting

Open the Sort menu in the header.

- **One-click toggle**: Select a column to sort; repeats toggle between ascending/descending.
- **Clear sort**: Resets ordering to default.
- **Visual feedback**: The button reflects when a sort is active.

## Tips

- Filters and sorting apply immediately to the grid (server-side friendly).
- The Filters button shows a count when any filters are active.
