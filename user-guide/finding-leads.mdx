## Overview

Use Flowi to discover and curate high-quality prospects fast. The leads workspace includes two tabs — Companies and People — with a spreadsheet-like grid, fast server-side loading, and powerful filters.

<Tip>
  The People tab includes email-specific actions. Use Companies for firm-level research and People for contact-level actions.
</Tip>

## Find prospects

<Steps>
<Step title="Describe your ideal customer">

Type what you’re looking for (industry, role, tech, region, size, etc.). Results stream into the grid as they’re found.

</Step>
<Step title="Refine with filters">

Open the Filters panel and combine attributes (e.g., job title contains "marketing", company website includes ".ai", has LinkedIn). Save frequently used filters for reuse.

</Step>
<Step title="Customize columns">

Show only what matters. Toggle default columns (email, job title, website, LinkedIn, address, relevance) and reorder to fit your workflow.

</Step>
<Step title="Select the right leads">

Use checkboxes or click-to-select. Multi-select supports Shift/Command. Right‑click to open the context menu for bulk actions.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk actions

- **Add to List…**: Save selected rows to a named list for later work and collaboration.
- **Find Emails…**: People tab only. Queue email discovery for selected contacts.
- **Download CSV**: Export selected rows for sharing or offline analysis.
- **Delete**: Permanently remove leads (company or people). This cannot be undone.

<Warning>
  Deletions are permanent. Consider exporting first if you might need the data later.
</Warning>

## Lists and saved work

- **Saved lists**: Create multiple lists, drag to reorder, and switch context quickly.
- **Views**: Keep different column/ordering preferences per tab.

## Tips

- Use the Companies tab to cast a wide net, then drill down into People and run email discovery.
- Right‑click any selection to open actions; keyboard selection works across virtualized rows.
- Relevance flags and research columns help you prioritize who to work on next.
