## Overview

Use Find New Customers to discover businesses and organizations from a simple, natural‑language request. Results stream into the grid, and you can keep expanding in batches until the area is covered.

<Tip>
  Toggle between <b>🔍 Find New Customers</b> and <b>💡 Ask Questions</b> at the bottom of the input. Use Find New Customers to <i>find businesses</i>. Use Ask Questions to <i>research existing leads</i> (contacts, CEOs, social links, emails, etc.).
  
</Tip>

## How searching works

- **One business type + one location**: Specify a single business type (e.g., "coffee shop") and a single geography (city, state/province, or country).
- **Up to 100 results per search**: Ask for “10”, “50”, or “100”. If you say “all/every”, the system searches across multiple neighbourhoods; ask for “100 more” to continue until the area is covered.
- **Smart coverage**: For broad geographies (states/countries), Flowi prioritizes where to look next and avoids duplicates while tracking progress.
- **What’s supported**: Businesses and public places. No people/influencer searches, and no filters beyond business type + location.
- **Clarifications**: If a location is ambiguous (e.g., “Kingston”) or you include multiple types/locations, you’ll be asked to clarify before the search runs.

<Warning>
  Unsupported filters (e.g., owner beliefs, political values, “female‑owned”) aren’t applied in search. Run the search first, then switch to <b>Ask Questions</b> to research and filter for these attributes.
</Warning>

## Run a search

<Steps>
<Step title="Switch to Find New Customers">

Click the toggle chips below the input and select <b>🔍 Find New Customers</b>.

</Step>
<Step title="Describe the businesses and location">

Type in plain English. Examples:

- "Find 50 coffee shops in Toronto, Ontario, Canada"
- "Hotels in Paris, France"
- "All restaurants in Vancouver, British Columbia"

Tips:
- Include a clear geography (city, state/province, or country).
- Ask for up to 100 per search. For more, say “100 more”.

</Step>
<Step title="Confirm the final query">

You may be shown a short confirmation with the exact Type, Geography, and Amount, or a small list of close **type variations** (e.g., cafe, coffee house, espresso bar). Pick one or confirm to proceed.

</Step>
<Step title="Review streaming results and expand">

Results populate the grid as they appear. If you need more, type “50 more” or “100 more” to continue. Flowi avoids duplicates and stops when the geography is exhausted.

<Check>
You see new rows appear in the grid and the total count increases.
</Check>

</Step>
<Step title="Prioritize and enrich">

Use the Relevance column to sort, then switch to <b>Ask Questions</b> to research selected leads (websites, social, contacts, and deeper analysis).

</Step>
</Steps>

## Supported vs unsupported requests

- **Supported**: “Find 100 nail salons in Miami, Florida”, “Coffee shops in Kingston, Ontario”, “Hotels in Canada”.
- **Needs clarification**: “Find cafes in Kingston” (which Kingston?), “restaurants in Toronto and Vancouver” (choose one), “restaurants and bars in NYC” (choose one type).
- **Unsupported (filter at research time)**: “cafes with female owners”, “eco‑friendly restaurants”, “bars that support a political party”.
- **Not supported**: People/influencer searches.

## Tips

- Use full place names (e.g., “Toronto, Ontario, Canada”) to avoid ambiguity.
- Saying “all” begins a multi‑neighbourhood sweep; then ask for “100 more” until done.
- If you repeat a search, the system detects prior work and focuses on fresh results.
